#  Autonomous Warehouse Robot System

Welcome to the official documentation and report for the **Autonomous Warehouse Robot Project**. This project simulates an **Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR)** designed to automate item picking and delivery in a warehouse using a goods-to-person model.

---

##  Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a fully autonomous warehouse automation system using 3D modeling and simulation to mimic real-world Kiva-style robots.
